# 50ville: SQL Mystery Task - README

Welcome to **50ville**, a thrilling SQL mystery!

The CS50 Duck has been stolen! The town of Fiftyville has called upon you to solve the mystery of the stolen duck. Authorities believe that the thief stole the duck and then, shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town with the help of an accomplice. Your goal is to identify:

1. **The Thief** - Who committed the crime?
2. **The City** - Where did the thief escape to?
3. **The Accomplice** - Who helped the thief?

You have been provided with the `fiftyville.db` SQLite database file. Using SQL queries, you will explore the database to gather clues and solve the mystery.

All you know is that the theft took place on **July 28, 2023** and that it took place on **Humphrey Street**.

### How to Start

1. **Download the Database:**
   - The database file is named `fiftyville.db`. Make sure you have this file in your working directory.

2. **Install SQLite3:**
   - If you don’t have SQLite installed, follow the instructions below for your operating system.

   #### **Windows**:
   - Download the SQLite tools from the official SQLite website: [SQLite Download Page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
   - Extract the zip file and copy the `.exe` files to a folder, such as `C:\sqlite`.
   - Add this folder to your system's PATH so you can run SQLite commands from any terminal:
     1. Open **Control Panel** > **System** > **Advanced system settings**.
     2. Click **Environment Variables**.
     3. Under **System Variables**, find the **Path** variable and click **Edit**.
     4. Add the path to the folder containing `sqlite3.exe`, like `C:\sqlite`.
   - Open **Command Prompt** and type `sqlite3` to ensure it’s working.

   #### **macOS**:
   - SQLite is pre-installed on macOS. To verify, open **Terminal** and type `sqlite3`.
   - If it’s not installed, you can use **Homebrew**:
     ```bash
     brew install sqlite3
     ```

   #### **Linux**:
   - SQLite is often pre-installed. If not, install it using your package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install sqlite3
     ```

3. **Open the Database:**
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Terminal) and navigate to the folder containing `fiftyville.db`. Run:
     ```bash
     sqlite3 fiftyville.db
     ```
   - This will open the SQLite interactive shell where you can run your SQL queries.

4. **Load the Schema**:
   - To see the tables and their structure, run:
     ```sql
     .tables
     ```
   - To view the schema of a specific table, use:
     ```sql
     PRAGMA table_info(table_name);
     ```
     Example: 
     ```sql
     PRAGMA table_info(crime_scene_reports);
     ```

### Useful SQL Commands

You will need to run SQL queries to extract information from the database. Below are some essential SQL commands that might be helpful for your investigation:

- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name;
    ```

- **WHERE**: Filter records based on conditions.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    ```

- **JOIN**: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
    ```

- **ORDER BY**: Sort results by one or more columns.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
    ```
